## Description

Hello and welcome to the world of cutting-edge social networks. This application is created using Mongoose and MongoDB to create the backend of a theoretical social network in which users can create and react to thoughts. Users and Thoughts can all be created, read, updated and deleted while the reactions can be read, created and deleted. The Reactions are linked to the thoughts and deletion of thoughts will delete reactions. Deletion of user will delete thoughts as well. Let's get into it!
